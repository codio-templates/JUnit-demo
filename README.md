### Documentation
[Click here](https://codio.com/docs/ide/features/junit/) to access the Codio documentation for JUnit.

### This demo
In the filetree you will find some very simple Java files to demonstrate JUnit. 

The Junit dialog can be opened by going to **Tools>JUnit** (or `Shift+Alt+J`). 

Add individual test cases by specifying the path(s) to `TestCalc1.java` and/or `TestJunit.java` file that contain the JUnit tests in the `Add test case` field or by dragging and dropping the file(s) into the JUnit tab and execute either from the Execute button that will be shown or from the JUnit Executions tab.

Once completed, the results will be listed.

You can also run a suite of tests by configuring 

- **Source path** (is the location of the student source code)
- **Test source path** (is the location of the test cases source folder)
- **Library path** (is the path to any libraries used by the student application)
- **Working directory** (is the path where the compiled student code should execute)

and then adding the relevant test cases
